# Bash Scripting Coding Assistant

This repository contains a basic chat interface that helps users convert natural language input into bash scripts. A fine-tuned version of the CodeLlama-7b model trained on a custom dataset is used. The dataset is of natural language commands and their corresponding Bash script outputs, making it capable of generating Bash scripts from natural language input prompts. The dataset is available on Hugging Face as [AnishJoshi/nl2bash-custom](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AnishJoshi/nl2bash-custom)
The finetuned model is also public on HuggingFace as [AnishJoshi/codellama2-finetuned-nl2bash-fin](https://huggingface.co/AnishJoshi/codellama2-finetuned-nl2bash-fin)
